/*
 * An example demonstrating Memory usage:
 *  - track: let Memory know that it is responsible for a particular pointer.
 *  - alloc: allocate a number of bytes from this Memory scope.
 *  - make : construct objects that this Memory scope knows about.
 *
 * The purpose of Memory is to reduce free/decref calls by the coder.
 * Simply make a new Memory scope with new_Memory() at the beginning
 * of the scope and call decref on the memory object to call decref on
 * all the memory blocks it is responsible for.
